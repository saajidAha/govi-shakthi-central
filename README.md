# Govishakthi App

## Introduction

Govishakthi is a mobile application designed to [insert a brief description of your app's purpose]. The project consists of a **frontend** built with **React Native** and **Expo** and a **backend** powered by **Node.js** with **Express.js** for handling API requests and data management.

## Frontend Installation (React Native with Expo)

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following tools installed:

- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
- **Expo CLI** (optional, but recommended for Expo commands)
  ```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/govishakthi-app.git
```

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd govishakthi-app/frontend
npm install
```

OR if you prefer Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

---

## Backend Installation (Node.js with Express)

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your system.

### Navigate to Backend Directory

After cloning the repository, navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd govishakthi-app/backend
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required backend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the App

### Frontend (React Native with Expo)

To run the frontend, navigate to the **frontend** directory and start the Expo server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

This will open the Expo development server. You can scan the QR code with the **Expo Go app** on your phone or use a simulator/emulator.

- For **iOS**:
  ```bash
  npx expo start --ios
  ```
- For **Android**:
  ```bash
  npx expo start --android
  ```

### Backend (Node.js with Express)

To start the backend server, navigate to the **backend** directory and run:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev // Compiles the .ts files to .js and run
```

The server will be running on `http://localhost:7000` (or a different port if you configure it). You can test the API using tools like **Postman** or integrate it with the frontend app.

## Testing Instructions

### Frontend Testing

- Unit Testing: Run Jest tests using:

  npm test

- Manual Testing: Use Expo Go or an emulator to manually verify UI functionality.

### Backend Testing

- API Testing with Postman:

  Send GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to verify API endpoints.

-Automated Testing with Jest:

  npm run test

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. Expo Not Starting

- Ensure you have installed Expo CLI globally:

  npm install -g expo-cli

- Try clearing the cache:

  expo start -c

2. Backend Server Not Running

- Ensure all dependencies are installed:

  npm install

- Check for TypeScript compilation errors before running:

  npm run build

3. Database Connection Failing

- Ensure MongoDB is running and the connection string is correct in your configuration file.
